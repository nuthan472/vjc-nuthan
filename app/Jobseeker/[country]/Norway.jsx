        <p>
          The Norway Jobseeker Visa is a residence permit that allows non-EU/EEA nationals to enter Norway for up to 6 months to look for a job. This visa is a great option for skilled professionals, researchers, and those looking to explore the job market in Norway before applying for a long-term work permit.

          During your stay, you can search for work, attend interviews, and network with potential employers. Once you secure a job offer, you can transition to a regular work visa.
