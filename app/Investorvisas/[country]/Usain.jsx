      <h2>Introduction to the USA Investor Visa</h2>
      <p>
        The USA offers several visa options for individuals wishing to invest in its economy, create jobs,
        and live in the United States. One of the most popular options is the <strong>EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program</strong>.
        This program allows eligible foreign nationals to obtain a U.S. Green Card (Permanent Residency) by making a qualifying
        investment in a U.S. business that creates or preserves jobs for U.S. workers.
